# Overview

People communicate with Artifical Intelligence (AI) Agents, which subsequentially perform actions on their behalf. AI Agents may communicate among themselves to archive goals, such as a Personal AI communicating with a Scheduling AI to schedule an appointment. AI Agents may communicate with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as to turn on a home appliance. With implementations of AI Agents such as Siri, Google Now, Amazon Alexa, these communications are closed, proprietary, and non-extensible. Communications with IoT devices are also typically proprietary to the device vendor and closed. The goal of AIMP is to provide an open specification of messages across AI, Human, and IoT device communications to provide extensibility, cross system compatibility, transparency, and security.
